This folder olds any obsolete modules that we created

These include modules such as clock_divider.sv, which was created before we switched to a 100hz clock_divider

Also includes modules such as synckey and encode which were created for ease of use but were replaced by pb_divider


We had too strong of an emotional connection to them to delete them, so they stay in this folder.
